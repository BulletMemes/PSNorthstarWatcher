# PSNorthstarWatcher
fakys really bad Powershell Northstar Server Watcher. Use at own risk. It is very minimalistic and a dev would probably cry when he saw it.
# Change .ps1 before first start
Please change the start variables before you run.
# Folder setup
Place those files before your Titanfall2 folders. Also make sure your Titanfall folders are numered correctly
# AHK Files
These are used for some weird workaround when the server spits message boxes. You need to compile them first.
# Symbolic Links
You can create symbolic links to original Titanfall 2 files so you dont need to occupy a lot of disk space.
