# PSNorthstarWatcher description
faky's really bad Powershell Northstar Server Watcher. Use at own risk. It is very minimalistic.

# L1ghthouse's PS Script
https://github.com/l1ghthouse/NorthstarScripts
Its really good, go have a look!
# How-To automatic mode
1) Double click `start PSNorthstarSetup`
2) Follow the instructions
3) If you want to start the servers again start `run Northstar Server Watcher`
# How-To (manual server and script setup)
For this example we are going to assume your Titanfall2 Game is at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin\Titanfall2`.
Then you create new subfolders (eg Origin\Titanfall2-1, Titanfall2-2) for each server. I recommend using symbolic links instead of copying the entire Titanfall2 folder.
1) Copy zip files to -> C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin.
2) Rename `example-northstar server watcher-config.ps1` to `northstar server watcher-config.ps1` 
3) Open `northstar server watcher-config.ps1` with a text editor (notepad).
4) Edit following variables:
5) `$originpath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin\"`
6) `$gamedirs = @("Titanfall2-1","Titanfall2-2")` add folder name for each Titanfall2 instance.
7) `$tcpportarray = @(8081,8082)` add TCP port for each Titanfall2 instance.
8) `$udpportarray = @(37015,37016)` add UDP port for each Titanfall2 instance.
9) Save file. 
10) Changing other variables is optional, but possible.
11) Change `ns_startup_args_dedi.txt` and `autoexec_ns_server.cfg` if needed (these are Northstar config files).

So folder structure should look like this:
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin
  - `run Northstar Server Watcher.bat`
  - `northstar server watcher-config.ps1`
  - `northstar server watcher.ps1`
  - `engineerrorclose.exe`
  - `\Titanfall2`
  - `\Titanfall2-1\R2Northstar`
  - `\Titanfall2-2\R2Northstar`

12) Now start `run Northstar Server Watcher.bat`. Now a Powershell command prompt should appear. 
13) If no window appears: Start Powershell as admin, type `Set-Executionpolicy -Executionpolicy Unrestricted`. Accept. This enables scripts without valid certificates to be executed.
14) Double click `index.html`(should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin\index.html`) to open your local server browser generated by this script.

# .ahk/.exe Files
These are used for some weird workaround when the server spits message boxes. (engineerrorclose.exe)
