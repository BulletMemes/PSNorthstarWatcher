# PSNorthstarWatcher description
faky's really bad Powershell Northstar Server Watcher. Use at own risk. It is very minimalistic.
# L1ghthouse's PS Script
https://github.com/l1ghthouse/NorthstarScripts
Its really good, go have a look!
# Change .ps1 before first start
Please change the start variables before you run.
# Folder setup
Place those files before your Titanfall2 folders. Also make sure your Titanfall folders are numered correctly
# AHK Files
These are used for some weird workaround when the server spits message boxes.
# Symbolic Links
You have create symbolic links to original Titanfall 2 files so you dont need to occupy a lot of disk space (See Screenshots).
